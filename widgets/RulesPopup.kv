Then people should never choose a number above 80 to win. But if everyone thinks the same, they should not choose a number above 64, as the average will not go beyond 80. This creates a dilemma that leads to people choosing smaller and smaller numbers."

This game is designed to recreate the game in Alice in Borderland, so that viewers can try it out for themselves. \nHere are the differences:\n1. The round time is shortened to 2 minutes. \n2. The GAME OVER score is changed to -5.\n3. Players can disconnect anytime, it counts as a GAME OVER for that player.\n4. Players need to type in the number digit by digit.\nThe changes are mainly to address the fast lifestyle of people outside of the Borderland, and the fact that your screen is smaller than the one the TV show uses."
